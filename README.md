Run main.py to play.

12/4/24 - State of the game

The game is ready to play!.

Follow the tutorial in game if you would rather not follow these directions!

throw frisbees by clicking for direction (power is based on distance clicked)
clicking and dragging to the left or right adds curve to the frisbee
spacebar pauses the game
's' steps one frame
backspace removes a frisbee
escape closes window
'r' resets the throw position so you can try your shot over, but adds 1 to the shot counter
'n' creates a new course, if you haven't completed the current course your score will not be added
'tab' swaps view between top-down and '3D' view
brown rectangles are simple wall obstacles
orange rectangles are bouncy wall obstacles
trees are not bouncy and will just send your throw into the ground (like if you threw a frisbee into a tree)
throwing the frisbee into the goal at the right height will score it, allowing you to press a key to play the next hole

arrowkeys pan the view in 2D and 3D

Sound effects and art are all made by me!
