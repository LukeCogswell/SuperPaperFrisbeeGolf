# SuperPaperFrisbeeGolf
Frisbee Flight Simulator Game - CMU 15112 Term Project

11/25/24 - State of the game

The game is essentially a crude but playable game with 'full' functionality.
(there are plenty of bugs and it needs tuning, but you can play frisbee courses and score the frisbee!)

throw frisbees by clicking for direction (power is based on distance clicked)
clicking and dragging to the left or right adds curve to the frisbee
spacebar pauses the game
's' steps one frame
backspace removes a frisbee
escape closes window
'r' resets/randomizes the course
'm' swaps view between top-down and '3D' view
black rectangles are simple wall obstacles
orange rectangles are bouncy wall obstacles
trees are not bouncy and will just send your throw into the ground
throwing the frisbee into the goal at the right height will score it, allowing you to click and reset the game to play again

'p' swaps between pitch control and initial up speed control
up and down arrows increase or decrease initial pitch and up speed

'n' creates a frisbee for debugging
