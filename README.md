# SuperPaperFrisbeeGolf
Frisbee Flight Simulator Game - CMU 15112 Term Project

12/3/24 - State of the game

The game is ready to play! There are a few bugs, but it can't crash and currently doesn't have wind.

Follow the tutorial in game if you would rather not follow these directions!

throw frisbees by clicking for direction (power is based on distance clicked)
clicking and dragging to the left or right adds curve to the frisbee
spacebar pauses the game
's' steps one frame
backspace removes a frisbee
escape closes window
'r' resets the throw position so you can try your shot over, but adds 1 to the shot counter
'n' creates a new course, if you haven't completed the current course your score will not be added
'tab' swaps view between top-down and '3D' view
black rectangles are simple wall obstacles
orange rectangles are bouncy wall obstacles
trees are not bouncy and will just send your throw into the ground
throwing the frisbee into the goal at the right height will score it, allowing you to click and reset the game to play again

'p' swaps between pitch control and initial up speed control
up and down arrows increase or decrease initial pitch and up speed

Sound effects and art are all made by me!
