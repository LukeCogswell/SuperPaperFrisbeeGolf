If you don't have the caveat font installed, you will need to install it for the best formatting experience.

Play frisbee golf on randomly generated courses and try to get the lowest score you can! Avoid obstacles or use them to your advantage to plan your most efficient route from start to finish. Beware of the wind and good luck!

# 12/5/24 - State of the game

The game is ready to play!.

Follow the tutorial in game if you would rather not follow these directions!

escape closes window
'r' resets the throw position so you can try your shot over, but adds 1 to the shot counter
'n' creates a new course, if you haven't completed the current course your score will not be added (mostly for debugging)
'tab' swaps view between top-down and '3D' view
brown rectangles are simple wall obstacles
orange rectangles are bouncy wall obstacles
trees are not bouncy and will just send your throw into the ground (like if you threw a frisbee into a tree)
throwing the frisbee into the goal at the right height will score it, allowing you to press a key to play the next hole
arrowkeys move the view in 2D and 3D

pressing escape during the tutorial will exit the tutorial

Sound effects and art are all made by me!

# Tips and Tricks

check the 3D view before your shot, sometimes walls are deceptively short!
using no pitch or roll and low up power in wind will significantly decrease the effect of the wind
You can use a geyser to your advantage if your throw starts near the geyser and you have some negative pitch, otherwise your frisbee is going to fly away
Putting is really easy with 0-10 pitch, 2-4 up power, 100% power, and 0 roll
